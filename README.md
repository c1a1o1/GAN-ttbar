# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in Particle Physics
This GitHub repository contains the code that was used in an attempt to use GANs in the field of Particle Physics at the European Organization of Nuclear Research (CERN). This project was an attempt to use GANs to simulate top-antitop quark production in proton-proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) at CERN. <br />
